# Big Cats Image Search Engine
This is my project for the information retrieval course. The repository contains the jupyter notebook that shows the mechanism of the search engine, and also the web app for demonstrating the search engine. There are two notebooks. First, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as the feature extractor and Euclidean Distance for calculating the similarities between images. Second, Local Binary Pattern (LBP) as the feature extactor and Chi-Squared distance for calculating the similarities between images.

## Implementation
For the implementation, I used:
- Python (The programming language)
- Tensorflow (For extracting features from the image using CNN)
- Scipy (For extracting features from the image using LBP)
- Numpy (For calculating similarities between images)
- Flask (For building the web app)
